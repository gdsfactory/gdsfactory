"""You can use component_sequence as a convenient function for cascading components, where you need to keep track of multiple tapers, doped sections, heaters etc...

The idea is to associate one symbol per type of section.
A section is uniquely defined by the component, input port name and output port name.

The mapping between symbols and components is supplied by a dictionary.
The actual chain of components is supplied by a string or a list
