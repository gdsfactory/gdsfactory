    "\n",
    "Most plugins leverage a file based cache, where you can store simulation results in files to avoid running the same simulation twice.\n",
    "This saves you a lot of computation time, as each FDTD simulation can take several minutes, or big simulations can take even hours.\n",
    "There are different types of simulation storage that you can use.\n",
