- fix position of rotated "no orientation" ports [PR](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/pull/951)
- Fix grating_coupler_elliptical_arbitrary component with how the ellipses are drawn. In the previous implementation, a constant neff is assumed for each grating unit cell, which is then used to determine the ellipticity of the teeth. However, for an apodized grating coupler, neff changes depending on the unit cell geometry (e.g. on duty cycle), so an apodized grating coupler would be drawn incorrectly. In addition, neff is not needed as an input, because it can be calculated from the period, wavelength, cladding index, and coupling angle, which are already inputs to the component.

## [5.15.3](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/pull/579)

- [PR](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/pull/576)
    - fix offgrid ports connect
    - Component.copy() and Component.flatten() don't assign fixed names to the output Component which could create name collisions. It is safer to keep the new cell's default name (with UID) to prevent this. The thought is that even a copied or flattened cell should be eventually placed inside a cell function with @cell decorator, which will remove the anonymous and unpredictable names (for those of us who care). And for those who don't care as much, at least they won't get dangerous side effects!
